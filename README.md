# Data Structure Visualization App Project
This project visualizes operations on data structures such as stack, queue, and list. It provides a graphical interface to demonstrate how these structures behave during various operations.

## Features
- **Stack:** Visualize create, push, pop, sort and search operations.
- **Queue:** Visualize create, enqueue, dequeue, sort and search operations.
- **List:** Visualize create, insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- **Chatbot:** Interact with Chatbot using API from ChatGPT.


## How to Use the Repository
To use this repository, you can clone it using the following command and run file `main.java` to start the visualization:
```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PhongTranCao/mini-project-OOP/tree/master
```
